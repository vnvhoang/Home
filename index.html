                <h2><span class="flashing-icon">üí•</span> Welcome to my personal website! <span class="flashing-icon">üí•</span></h2>
                <p>I am delighted to have you here and to share my journey in the world of computational mechanics. My name is Hoang, and I hold a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in the vibrant city of Hanoi, Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Currently, I find myself immersed in the fascinating world of academic research as an international visiting scholar at Huanghuai University in Henan, China. This incredible opportunity has allowed me to broaden my horizons and collaborate with excellent researchers, further fueling my passion for the field.</p>
                <p>But the excitement doesn't end there. I stand on the brink of a new and thrilling chapter in my academic and professional journey. I am eagerly preparing to embark on a Master of Science program at the prestigious Shanghai Jiao Tong University in the bustling metropolis of Shanghai, China, where I aim to delve deeper into the intricacies of mechanics.</p>
                <p>My ultimate aspiration is to become a leading scientist in the realm of computational mechanics, contributing to the advancement of this field and solving complex engineering challenges. I believe that the future holds boundless opportunities for innovation, and I am determined to be at the forefront of it.</p>
                <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I lead a balanced life. I have a strong affinity for sports, including volleyball and chess, which not only keeps my mind and body in sync but also fosters a sense of healthy competition. However, my true passion lies in calisthenics, where I continually challenge and push my physical boundaries while enjoying the elegance of bodyweight exercises.</p>
                <p>I invite you to explore my website to learn more about my academic endeavors, research interests, and my personal journey. Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey, and I look forward to sharing my experiences and insights with you as I progress toward my goal of becoming a prominent figure in the world of computational mechanics.</p>
